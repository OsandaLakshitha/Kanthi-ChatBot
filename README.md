Kanthi-ChatBot

Welcome to Kanthi-ChatBot, a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Google's Generative AI!
About the Bot

Kanthi is a friendly, conversational AI chatbot that was created with a warm and approachable personality. The name "Kanthi" is a Sri Lankan name, and I found it amusing, which is why I chose it for this project. This is my first attempt at building an AI chatbot, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you!
Chatbot Evolution

Before diving into AI, I created two earlier versions of this chatbotâ€”one without using AI and the other based on just my own hand-crafted prompts. Now, with the help of Google Generative AI, Kanthi has become even more interactive and capable of handling complex conversations with ease.
Features:

    AI-powered conversations: Kanthi now generates intelligent, context-aware responses based on your input.
    Chat history: Keep track of your conversations by saving and loading chat history.
    Friendly and warm tone: Kanthiâ€™s responses are designed to be supportive, empathetic, and encouraging.

I hope you enjoy using Kanthi! Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful example of how AI can enhance human-computer interaction.
