<h1>Kanthi-ChatBot</h1>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Kanthi-ChatBot</strong>, a simple AI-powered chatbot built using Google's Generative AI!</p>

<h2>About the Bot</h2>
<p><strong>Kanthi</strong> is a friendly, conversational AI chatbot that was created with a warm and approachable personality. The name "Kanthi" is a Sri Lankan name, and I found it amusing, which is why I chose it for this project. This is my first attempt at building an AI chatbot, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you!</p>

<h2>Chatbot Evolution</h2>
<p>Before diving into AI, I created two earlier versions of this chatbotâ€”one without using AI and the other based on just my own hand-crafted prompts. Now, with the help of <strong>Google Generative AI</strong>, <strong>Kanthi</strong> has become even more interactive and capable of handling complex conversations with ease.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI-powered conversations</strong>: Kanthi now generates intelligent, context-aware responses based on your input.</li>
    <li><strong>Chat history</strong>: Keep track of your conversations by saving and loading chat history.</li>
    <li><strong>Friendly and warm tone</strong>: Kanthiâ€™s responses are designed to be supportive, empathetic, and encouraging.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy using Kanthi! Itâ€™s a simple yet powerful example of how AI can enhance human-computer interaction.</p>
